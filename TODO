- think of a more modular way of generating the file?
-- e.g.: have a "generic" header & add comments to it
-- remove other comments (they may be redundant)
-- add $institute or $company variable
-- add UCF file to template
- see where DOC is
- see whether it makes sense to add DOC or add HOWTO
- create said HOWTO
